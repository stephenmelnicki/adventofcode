# Advent of Code

My typescript solutions to the Advent of Code challenges.

Enjoy!

# Dependencies

This project was written using using the latest LTS version of [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

You're welcome to use whatever version of node you'd like, but your mileage may vary.

# Installation

```
npm install
```

# Running

Each day's answers are logged to the console. To get a desired day's answers, run the typescript compiler (if you haven't already) and then run node on the generated output.

For example, to get the first day's solutions for 2022:

```
npm build
node 2022/day1
```
