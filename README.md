# Advent of Code

My typescript solutions to the Advent of Code challenges.

Enjoy!

## Dependencies

This project was written using using the latest version of
[deno](https://deno.land/manual@v1.29.2/getting_started/installation).

## Running

Each day's answers are logged to the console. To get a desired day's answers,
run the typescript compiler (if you haven't already) and then run node on the
generated output.

For example, to get the first day's solutions for 2022:

```
npm build
node 2022/day1
```
